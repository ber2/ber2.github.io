      <description>I have given a talk at the Barcelona PyDay 2020, which is taking place as an online event on December 12th, 2020.
The title of the talk is Counting votes: analyzing a large dataset with Dask.
The purpose of the talk is to exhibit a use case in which Dask excels, in my opinion: working with datasets which do not fit into single machine memory but still are reasonably small not to require going to a cluster.</description>
