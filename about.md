**Alberto CÃ¡mara**. I come from **[Montserrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_(mountain))**.

I am a Maths PhD currently based in the Barcelona area, doing stuff with data. When I am not in
front of a screen I try to get to the mountains.

In here I write about my own projects and stuff that caught my attention, mostly in the area of data
science & analysis in Python and functional programming in Scala.

Opinions are my own.

The stuff I code and publish may be found on [github](https://github.com) / [ber2](https://github.com/ber2).

Preferred contact method is by email at `camara <at> protonmail <dot> com`. I may also be found on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/b3r2s) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-camara).
