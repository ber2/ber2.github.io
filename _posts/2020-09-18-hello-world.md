Hi!

Yes, I have decided to try out Github Pages and set up a small site using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I have followed the straightforward instructions available [here](https://pages.github.com/) and
it's been a (mostly) painless journey.

I really like being able to write in markdown locally, then publish by updating a remote git repo.
I plan to keep trying some features in order to personalize the site a bit.
